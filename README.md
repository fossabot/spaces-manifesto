# spaces-manifesto
Manifesto for the Spaces social network

## FAQs
Yes, this is a cliche. Everyone wants to make a social network and get rich. This one is a bit different :blush:

### Why is it any different?
This one is meant to be built by the people, for the people. I wish to use this repository as an whiteboard that anyone (let alone developers) can suggest and ask for features they definitely would like in a social network.

### [so-and-so-company] said the same, duh.
Totally agree. Also, [so-and-so-company] never gave you the source code :wink: We do. All our source code is open sourced and forever will be. All our source code will use frameworks and tools that are open sourced as well. In short, there is a 100% transparency rule in whatever is done here. Every feature added, every bug fixed - you can see where. We don't like walls - not that anyone asked. :fire:

### Why does this need to exist anyway? :expressionless:
Because it's 2018 and it needs to. The whole privacy sensitivity has taken the world by berserk. Even then, how many of the leading companies have shown an increase in transparency or accountability? We are still plagued by news of user information being stolen, or leaked or sold out. Does this have no end? Shouldn't privacy be a fundamental right?

### So everything is open - including the software stack? :astonished:
Yes - no big plans right away about the stack, but here is a small roadmap in mind
* Eclipse Vert.x for the server [https://vertx.io/]
* PostgreSQL as the primary database [https://www.postgresql.org/]
* Minio as the blob datastore [https://minio.io/]
* Angular as the front-end framework [https://angular.io/]

### Can I modify this readme as well, then?
Oh yeah. Raise a PR and I'll send a personal thank you for your contribution. Added points for puns or sarcasm :boom:

### Why should we believe you?
Fair question. Every single commit made to our repositories (including this one), is scanned for regulatory and audit compliance. Thanks to the folks at FOSSA, we have this nifty badge appearing at the bottom of all our READMEs. If you've not heard of them - you should, they're awesome. [https://app.fossa.io]. Short story - the FOSSA guys give us a knuckle bump if any of the frameworks or tools (including dependencies of our dependencies - oh yeah, it's that awesome :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:) don't disclose their source code with a permissive license.
